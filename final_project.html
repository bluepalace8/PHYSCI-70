  ### Final Project: Detecting if the compost of your composting toilet is ready

  ## Note that I had COVID and strep for the week leading up to the final project symposium; the first day out of isolation was the day of the symposium :( Hence, I'll also be covering some of my inNoVatIve TecHNIques during quarantine and while being sick

 ## Background

 Over 40% of the world does not have access to a flushing toilet. By contaminating water, open defecation gives rise to a host of diseases including diarrhea, intestinal worm infections, typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, and polio. Moreover, there are a variety of social issues associated with a lack of toilets within households. For instance, open defecation is not socially accepted for females. This has severe implications. Women are chastised or beaten for openly defecating in the public during the day. That means that from a productivity and quality of life standpoint, those same women, because they don’t want to go to the bathroom during the day, may drink less water or manage their diet in a way so they don’t have to.

Furthermore, females who go to community toilets are often preyed upon. 
Currently, there is a container system present in some areas. This bucket is emptied by being brought to a fecal waste management facility; sometimes, these facilities are very far away. One of the challenges is it fills up quickly and the more often it fills up, the more they have to pay to have it emptied. In addition, many community toilets are unclean and pay-per-use, which further incentivizes open defecation. 


This need for better sanitation has spurred a world-wide effort to brainstorm and implement ways to make toilets more accessible. Some toilets are funded by universities and governments. Others are funded by, at least in some part, philanthropy organizations. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation launched the “Reinvent the Toilet Challenge” in 2011 and has had subsequent “Reinvent the Toilet” fairs and expos, with the most recent one being in 2018. At these fairs and expos, scientists show off their toilet designs for the chance to be further funded by the foundation. To date, the foundation has committed more than 200 million dollars. These innovative toilet designs come in different forms, including one that concentrates sunlight to disinfect waste and one that uses ultrasound (sound waves) to remove air pockets from waste, allowing the waste to be more compact. All are linked by a common thread: these toilets are not connected to sewer, water, or electrical lines. 


 One of the innovative self-containing toilets is a composting toilet. There are some different types of composting toilets. For instance, the Tiger Worms toilet (http://www.tbfenvironmental.in/) uses tiger worms to degrade waste into compost. 
  There are also these two-pit composting toilets (https://www.sulabhinternational.org/sulabh-technologies/). These toilets are also here in our home turf. In Boston, there is also a composting toilet company (https://clivusmultrum.com/)

  The question is: how can you tell when the compost is ready? Obviously, you can keep on checking the feces turned compost or gain experience in telling when it's ready. However, it would be much more convenient (and accurate) if there were objective metrics to let you know if your compost is ready. 

  Thus, my idea is to integrate sensors, specifically a temperature sensor and a sensor that detects methane levels, to tell the user if their compost is ready.

  ## Electronics 

 ## Dry Box
 I wanted to have a dry box for my electronics. After all, my electronics would be in a composting pit. Thus, I wanted the electronics (breadboard, wires, ESP32, battery, etc) to be dry. Thus, I decided to make a box that I could use to easily access the ESP32 and electronics but also would have a lid to close it. Moreover, 

 To do this, I first looked at this link 



 Here is the CAD file!

After 3D printing it, I used pliers to yank out the support structure. This is all the stuff I yanked out!

## Assembling the different parts together 

I have 

Because I was in isolation due to COVID, my soldering composed of twisting the wires together and using the hot glue in my room to secure the wires together.

Here is what it looked like for 

I also then secured the female end of the wires for the gas sensors using glue and to ensure that it would secured tight enough for the gas sensor to easily plug into it. 

## Future directions
*Originally, I was also going to integrate a pH sensor, but it did not arrive--no worries-- and hence would be a good future direction
*Since I was in isolation, I was unable to test my device on actual compost and provide the precise cutoff values for a Hence, actually testing the device and getting these values would be important.
