  ### About Me

  Hi! I'm Pallas :) Thanks for stopping by! 

  I love sushi, science puns, and the Oxford comma. I concentrate in Chemical and Physical Biology and have a secondary in Government. I enjoy understanding how systems work--biological systems, political systems, you name it! I'm currently doing research on how enzymes work together to make antibiotics. In my spare time, I love watching sunrises with friends. 

  This website contains the work I will be doing in the course "Introduction to Digital Fabrication." Come explore with me!
