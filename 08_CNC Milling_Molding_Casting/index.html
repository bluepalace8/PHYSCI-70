  ### Week 8: CNC Milling, Molding & Casting

  ### CNC Milling 

  #### Background of Casting and Molding Idea

My boyfriend has a YouTube channel (Powerhouse of the Cell), and recently we worked on a video together in which we animated assembly line proteins  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRG0Jnz_gG0&t=63s). To celebrate our accomplishment, I wanted to give him a piece of wall decor. Essentially, there would be a neuron that is present in all of his videos.

  For now, I think I'm going to go with project idea number 2 (with the spinal cord MGH idea) since it's the most concrete and has a real-life impact. But if 2 doesn't work out, I'll most likely do 3.
