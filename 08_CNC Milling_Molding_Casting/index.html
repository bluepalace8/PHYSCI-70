  ### Week 8: CNC Milling, Molding & Casting

  ### CNC Milling 

  #### Background of Casting and Molding Idea

My boyfriend has a YouTube channel (Powerhouse of the Cell), and recently we worked on a video together in which we animated assembly line proteins  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRG0Jnz_gG0&t=63s). To celebrate our accomplishment, I wanted to give him a piece of wall decor. Essentially, there would be a neuron that is present in all of his videos. And on the neuron, I would put a heart (becuase, you know, we're dating and heart = lovey dovey stuff). The idea is, later on, I could write a note on the heart. 

  ### Designing the File (Photoshop, Illustrator, Fusion)

  My boyfriend previously had the file corresponding to the neuron. However, as mentioned in the introduction, I also want to insert a heart into the middle. Hence, I used Fusion to to do this. 
  This is the overview of my workflow ![workflow](./workflow.png)


  In the below section, I'll be walking through some of the troubles I encountered with the file upon uploading it into the shopboat and ways in which I tried changing/improving it. 

  ### Using the Shopbot
  I followed Joon's tutorial to use the Shopbot. 

  I realized my vector file is connected to each outer. For instance, the outer lines loops into the inner line. Thus, when I click the outer line, it also highlights the inner line. 

  I tried adding a line (both with Aspire and also Fusion) or adding line breaks on it. However, there was no luck. When I highlighted the outer line, parts of the inner line would often also be highlighted (Fig. 3). There were other outer lines that were able to be highlighted separately from the inner line. (Fig 4). However, due to the aforementioned problems, I decided to ask my boyfriend if he had a file of the neuron where the outer lines aren't connected to the inner lines. However upon uploading onto my computer and also 

  Upon the upload of the heart file, I scaled the heart to double the size of the original file since I wanted to be able to hold enough jewelry. I knew I had to double the size because one of the aspire windows showed the dimensions. When I used a caliper 

  ### Casting and Molding

  ### Background of Casting and Molding Idea
  I also wanted to make a statue of my hand holding my boyfriendâ€™s hand through casting and molding. This was inspired by an Instagram ad that I saw of a statue of a hand. To do this, I recruited my boyfriend (he was enthralled, of course, for the opportunity to hold my hand for an extended period of time). 


  ### Making the hand mold
  I used the skin safe (Alja-safe) alginate molding powder. The powder was pink-purple. I mixed water in a 1:1 ratio with water, per the instructions. The instructions also suggested using a hand mixer or a beater attached to a drill; however, I was unable to find one in the lab (and also could not find one in stock at the local CVS). Thus, I needed to hand-mix the powder and water.
  The instructions suggested making a test mold of the thumb first. This went swimmingly, presumably in the hindsight because I needed to mix a smaller quantity of Alja-safe and water. Since the instructions suggested warm water, I


  ###Filling in the plaster
  There were two types of plaster: hydrostone and drystone. I decided to test one version with the hydrostone and one version with the drystone. The hydrostone required (by weight) 32 parts of water for 100 parts of the powder. The drystone required (by weight) 18-20 parts (I used 20) of water for 100 parts of the powder. Then, the easier process would be used for 

  To note, the alginate mold indicated that we should fill in the plaster within 4 hours; after 4 hours, the alginate mold would begin to degrade.
