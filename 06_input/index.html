  ### Week 6: Electronic input devices


  #Background on Project

I had a really emotionally week + was trying to book an appointment for HUHS; if you see this message, this means this page hasn't been finished yet but will be shortly completed. Don't want to get to details here, but reach out if you have any questions

 
# Thermosister

My potential final project is related to composting toilets. Hence, I thought it would be valuable to look into making a thermosister, which could be used in examples like measuring the temperature of the compost that comes out of the composting toilet. To do this, I looked at the Arduino create website as reference (https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Marcazzan_M/how-easy-is-it-to-use-a-thermistor-e39321). I then recreated the circuit displayed in the pictorial.

I then looked at the code corresponding to the thermosister and played around with it. 

# Capacitative sensing + Sound 

During lab on Thursday, Rob and I explored using capacitative sensing for sound. Essentially, we had put copper sheets in the metal bowl like so

#reflections
It was super cool to work further with electronics. As someone with no electronics background and someone who hasn't worked with sensors, this was a very valuable experience! I'm hoping to use these skills
