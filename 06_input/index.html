  ### Week 6: Electronic input devices


  #Background on Project
So, today, I will be doing three things
1. Make a capacitive sensor to measure a physical quantity with your microcontroller.
- I will discuss my three versions of this
2. Select another sensor of your choosing (temperature, microphone, etc.).
- I will specifically be using a thermosister. 
3. Calibrate each sensor and visualize data in the form of a table or graph. Discuss the relationship between the signals recorded by your microcontroller and the physical quantities that you're measuring.
- I will be discussing how I did this in each section. 
 
# Thermosister

My potential final project is related to composting toilets. Hence, I thought it would be valuable to look into making a thermosister, which could be used in examples like measuring the temperature of the compost that comes out of the composting toilet. To do this, I looked at the Arduino create website as reference (https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Marcazzan_M/how-easy-is-it-to-use-a-thermistor-e39321). I then recreated the circuit displayed in the pictorial.

I then looked at the sample code corresponding to the thermosister and played around with it. Notably, the top display types in the degrees for Kelvin and Celsius. However, it only prints the graph for the 

This turned out to be a larger challenge than originally thought. I tried putting print commands in various locations, all to no luck. 



## Calibration
To calibrate it, I borrowed a thermometer from my lab and compared it to the temperature that I was getting on my serial monitor. It was about 11 degrees C. Hence, I accounted for that in my code by subtracting 11 degrees when calculating temperature. 

# Capacitative sensing + Sound 

During lab on Thursday, Rob and I explored using capacitative sensing for sound. Essentially, we had put copper sheets in the metal bowl like so

#Reflections
It was super cool to work further with electronics. As someone with no electronics background and someone who hasn't worked with sensors, this was a very valuable experience! I'm hoping to use these skills in my final project and beyond. Especially since I see a lot of cool projects with sensors on YouTube (such as on the channels of Michael Reeves and Simone Giertz), I think I have the confidence to use these sensors in cool projects!
