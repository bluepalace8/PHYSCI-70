  ### Week 6: Electronic input devices


  #Background on Project

## This week, I was trying to make a whack-a-COVID. Essentially, with a 

I primarily wanted to do this because I thought it would be interesting to learn how to convert rotational motion to

# Thermosister

My potential final project is related to composting toilets. Hence, I thought it would be valuable to look into making a thermosister, which could be used in examples like measuring the temperature of the compost that comes out of the composting toilet. To do this, I looked at the Arduino create website as reference (https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Marcazzan_M/how-easy-is-it-to-use-a-thermistor-e39321). I then recreated the circuit displayed in the pictorial.

I then looked at the code corresponding to the thermosister and played around with it. Notably, the top 

# Capacitative sensing + Sound 

During lab on Thursday, Rob and I explored using capacitative sensing for sound. Essentially, we had put copper sheets in the metal bowl like so

#Reflections
It was super cool to work further with electronics. As someone with no electronics background and someone who hasn't worked with sensors, this was a very valuable experience! I'm hoping to use these skills in my final project and beyond. Especially since I see a lot of cool projects with sensors on YouTube (such as on the channels of Michael Reeves and Simone Giertz), I think I have the confidence to use these sensors in cool projects!
