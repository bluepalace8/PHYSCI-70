  ### Week 10: Machines


  #Background on Project

## This week, I was trying to make a whack-a-COVID. Essentially, with the awfulness of COVID, I wanted to see if I could make a whack-a-mole but with COVID instead of a mole. 

I primarily wanted to do this because I thought it would be interesting to learn how to convert rotational motion to linear motion. This is also a challenge in terms of positioning, which a stepper motor would be helpful for. 
I consulted this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BkYcqe8Vmo&t=54s) for some inspiration as to some cartoons in terms of how to make linear motion from rotational motion. 

 
# Stepper motor and breadboard

Stepper motors allow for smoother motion through incremental "steps." They can also carry a decent load and have good positional control. One of the cons, however, is that it is bulkier. 

I first made sure that my Stepper motor could work and function. Here is a picture of my breadboard
![machine_breadboard](./machine_breadboard.jpg). To note, my stepPin is 4, and my dirPin is 5. Moreover, I wired the breadboard (Kassia also helped me with this) so no external battery needed to be hooked up. You'll notice by looking at the image that I used an Arduino Feather. On the breadboard, there is also a capacitor and the driver (red). The wiring allows the code to be executed and tells the motor what to do. This page (https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/12_machine/steppers.html) details the benefits of Stepper motors and the function of each component. 

I made sure to select the correct output port and have the board be the Feather. Nathan's website here(https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/10_networking/setup.html) details how to set up to accept the Arduino feather. 


# Code

To see how rapid something was moving/better picture the movement of the code, I attached a piece of cardboard ot the shaft of the motor ![cardboard](./cardboard.jpg). That way, when the motor turns, I was able to better picture what was going on. ![stepper motor](./stepper-motor.png). 

I initially adapted the code we used in lab by altering the 

However, I realized a fundamental flaw: for a whack-a-covid, we don't: myuch like covid, it surprises us when it comes up. 

Hence, I adapted the other code 



#Making the COVID virus, joints 

Here is the vector file I used for the virus: I found it off of the internet but essentially wanted to make sure it would be a simple outline. The holes are also a bonus feature because I can attach my rods to it through the holes. I decided to just hotglue my virus to the rod instead because there's no point in attaching it through a bolt. 

When I ran this file, I did it with a speed of 100 and a power of 45 but since it took a while to cut, I think I could up the speed next time especially since I did it on cardboard. 


In the future, if this works I would probably 3D print my COVID virus molecule so it could endure more impact.

#Reflections
It was super cool to work further with electronics and working with Stepper motors, which I haven't worked with before. Especially since stepper motors are more precise/has smooth motion, I'm excited to have learned how to use it.
