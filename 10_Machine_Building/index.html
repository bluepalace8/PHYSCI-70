  ### Week 10: Machines


  #Background on Project: Rise of COVID/whack-a-COVID

## This week, I was trying to make a whack-a-COVID. Essentially, with the awfulness of COVID, I wanted to see if I could make a whack-a-mole but with COVID instead of a mole. 

I primarily wanted to do this because I thought it would be interesting to learn how to convert rotational motion to linear motion. This is also a challenge in terms of positioning, which a stepper motor would be helpful for. 
I consulted this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BkYcqe8Vmo&t=54s) for some inspiration as to some cartoons in terms of how to make linear motion from rotational motion. 

Here is the final product (2X speed since the original file was too big to be made into a gif). I'll detail how I made this below.

# Stepper motor and breadboard

Stepper motors allow for smoother motion through incremental "steps." They can also carry a decent load and have good positional control. One of the cons, however, is that it is bulkier. 

I first made sure that my Stepper motor could work and function. Here is a picture of my breadboard
![machine_breadboard](./machine_breadboard.jpg). To note, my stepPin is 4, and my dirPin is 5. Moreover, I wired the breadboard (Kassia also helped me with this) so no external battery needed to be hooked up. You'll notice by looking at the image that I used an Arduino Feather. On the breadboard, there is also a capacitor and the driver (red). The wiring allows the code to be executed and tells the motor what to do. This page (https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/12_machine/steppers.html) details the benefits of Stepper motors and the function of each component. 

I made sure to select the correct output port and have the board be the Feather. Nathan's website here (https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/10_networking/setup.html) details how to set up to accept the Arduino feather. 

#Making the COVID virus, joints, and accessories

## COVID

Here is the vector file I used for the virus: I found it off of the internet but essentially wanted to make sure it would be a simple outline. The holes are also a bonus feature. I then made a hole that could fit my screw. In my first version, I decided to just hotglue my virus to the rod instead because I thought there was no point in attaching it through a bolt. 

![covid](./covid.png)

When I ran this file, I did it with a speed of 100 and a power of 45 but since it took a while to cut, I think I could up the speed next time especially since I did it on cardboard. 

After repeated prototyping and my struggles (that will be described in the later sections), I realized that I should laser cut it again with wood to be more sturdy. After multiple days of working with my carboard COVID, it had begun to bend and was a bit flimsy. Hence, I laser cut it on wood to be studier (as opposed to carboard the first round). I did it with 65 power and 10 speed. 

In the future, if this works I would probably 3D print my COVID virus molecule so it could endure more impact.

I then made a variety of different joints on the laser cutter. When I designed it on Fusion, I made sure it was compatible with M4 nuts and bolts. Moreover, I made there a lot of holes so I can experiment with the linkages and what would make the Corona successfully "pop" out the best To note, initially, because I used this composite wood material, it was a bit hard to cut. Hence, I had to fish it out using the spreader like so: 



## Infrastructure

For the infrastructure itself, I decided to use cups for my first prototype. Essentially, I laser cut the top, which is wood with a slit for the coronavirus molecule to go through. I then glued the top onto cups that were taped onto each other. 
![cups](./cups_prototype.jpg)

However, the base with the cups was two flimsy and kept on being toppled over. Hence, I decided to do something more secure. This made me decide to make a box for me to be able to put all the electronics. I measured the dimensions that I wanted for the box. I wanted the box to be 23.5 CM X 20 CM X 10 CM. I first ensured everything was up to par on Fusion. Then, I downloaded it as a dxf file and transferred it to the laser cutting software: 
![laser cut wood panels](./laser_cut_box.jpg). 

I originally wanted it to be cut out of acrylic instead wood so I could see the mechanism through an acrylic box. Unfortunatately, while making this project, we only had a little bit of continuous acrylic left--not enough to make my box. Hence, I ended up cutting the box with wood as the material 

This is what it looks like after being cut: 
![wood panels](./wood_panels.jpg). 

I cut the other half of the box out of carboard because at this point in time, we had actually unfortunately run out of wood. Moreover, the one benefit of having half of the box out of thick carboard is I could cut out a panel in the back for me to change things if needed.

# Code

To see how rapid something was moving/better picture the movement of the code, I attached a piece of cardboard ot the shaft of the motor ![cardboard](./cardboard.jpg). That way, when the motor turns, I was able to better picture what was going on. ![stepper motor](./stepper-motor.png). 

I initially adapted the code we used in lab by altering the duration of the delay to be shorter. 
![first code](./stepper-motor-code.png)

However, I realized a fundamental flaw: for a whack-a-covid, we don't: want to know when the COVID will rise up. Much like covid, it surprises us when it comes up. 

Hence, I decided to write this other code, piecing together components of different sample code, testing it, and making sure it works. 
![2nd code](./stepper-motor-2-clean.png)
![2nd code](./stepper-motor-2-clean-2.png). 

In terms of my testing process, I wanted when the COVID to pop up to be random. In addition, the COVID molecule needs to be able to come through the slit at the right angle and right position. 




#Modifications

The stepper motor kept vibrating too much, so I decided to hook it to a stronger external battery. Thus, 


#Reflections
It was super cool to work further with electronics and working with Stepper motors, which I haven't worked with before. Especially since stepper motors are more precise/has smooth motion, I'm excited to have learned how to use it. Working with a stepper motor was a little finicky though, so now I know the benefits/cons of using a stepper motor.
