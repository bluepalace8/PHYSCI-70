  ### Week 10: Machines


  #Background on Project

## This week, I was trying to make a whack-a-COVID. Essentially, with the awfulness of COVID, I wanted to see if I could make a whack-a-mole but with COVID instead of a mole. 

I primarily wanted to do this because I thought it would be interesting to learn how to convert rotational motion to linear motion. This is also a challenge in terms of positioning, which a stepper motor would be helpful for. 
I consulted this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BkYcqe8Vmo&t=54s) for some inspiration as to some cartoons in terms of how to make linear motion from rotational motion. 

 
# Stepper motor and breadboard

Stepper motors allow for smoother motion through incremental "steps." They can also carry a decent load and have good positional control. One of the cons, however, is that it is bulkier. 

I first made sure that my Stepper motor could work and function. Here is a picture of my breadboard
![machine_breadboard](./machine_breadboard.jpg). To note, my stepPin is 4, and my dirPin is 5. Moreover, I wired the breadboard (Kassia also helped me with this) so no external battery needed to be hooked up. You'll notice by looking at the image that I used an Arduino Feather. On the breadboard, there is also a capacitor and the driver (red). The wiring allows the code to be executed and tells the motor what to do. This page (https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/12_machine/steppers.html) details the benefits of Stepper motors and the function of each component. 

I made sure to select the correct output port and have the board Nathan's website here(https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/10_networking/setup.html) details how to set up to accept the Arduino feather. 

However, I was curious if I could 

# Code

During lab on Thursday, Rob and I explored using capacitative sensing for sound. Essentially, we had put copper sheets in the metal bowl like so 



#Reflections
It was super cool to work further with electronics and working with Stepper motors, which I haven't worked with before. Especially since stepper motors
