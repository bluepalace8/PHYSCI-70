  ### Week 8: CNC Milling, Molding & Casting

  ### CNC Milling 

  #### Background of Casting and Molding Idea

My boyfriend has a YouTube channel (Powerhouse of the Cell), and recently we worked on a video together in which we animated assembly line proteins  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRG0Jnz_gG0&t=63s). To celebrate our accomplishment, I wanted to give him a piece of wall decor. Essentially, there would be a neuron that is present in all of his videos. And on the neuron, I would put a heart (becuase, you know, we're dating and heart = lovey dovey stuff). The idea is, later on, I could write a note on the heart. 

  ### Designing the File (Photoshop, Illustrator, Fusion)

  My boyfriend previously had the file corresponding to the neuron. However, as mentioned in the introduction, I also want to insert a heart into the middle. Hence, I used Fusion to to do this (Fig. 1). 
  This is the overview of my workflow ![workflow](./workflow.png)


  In the below section, I'll be walking through some of the troubles I encountered with the file upon uploading it into the shopboat and ways in which I tried changing/improving it. 

  ### Using the Shopbot

  I followed Joon's tutorial (https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/07_cnc/Shopbot_Aspire.pdf) to use the Shopbot. Since I wanted to keep this object and potentially give it as a gift, I decided to use a piece of nice plywood I found on the shelf. Per Joon's suggestion, I drilled the wood into the sacraficial wood. I made sure to make sure that the nails could get into the sacarafice wood without sticking up too much (originally I had a nail that was too long that I took out due to concern that it would interfere with the shopbot.)

  I measured the width of my wood (0.75 of an inch) and entered it into the Shopbot. I also made sure to adjust the height of the Shopbot to ensure the drill bit had a piece of paper in between it and the wood.

  After uploading my file into the Shopbot, I realized my vector file is connected to each outer. For instance, the outer lines loops into the inner line. Thus, when I click the outer line, it also highlights the inner line. 

  ![neuron fuzzy] (./neuron_fuzzy.png)

  I tried adding a line (I tested with Aspire, Fusion, and also Illustrator) or adding line breaks on it.  However, there was no luck. When I highlighted the outer line, parts of the inner line would often also be highlighted; moreover, parts of the line would be terminated  (Fig. 3). There were other outer lines that were able to be highlighted separately from the inner line. (Fig 4). However, due to the aforementioned problems, I decided to ask my boyfriend if he had a file of the neuron where the outer lines aren't connected to the inner lines. In essence, the file was able to be edited so there wouldn't be an outline line. However upon uploading onto my computer and also Fusion, I realized that since the file was made in photoshop, the lines were not super clean and were instead made of fragments. 

  Thus, I decided to focus on just the heart aspect. Thus, I could still learn how to use the shopbot. I thus shifted focus into making the heart as a way to display my jewelry. Hence, I needed to pocket cut. I uploaded a vector file of a heart that had two lines (fig. 5) -- an inner drawing of a heart and an outer outline of a heart. Upon the upload of the heart file, I scaled the heart to double the size of the original file since I wanted to be able to hold enough jewelry. I knew I had to double the size because one of the aspire windows showed the dimensions and upon using a ruler to measure the air, I realized that the displayed size was too small. I used a caliper to approximate/estimate how big to make the heart and thus specified it into the aspire software.

  Then, I specified to use a pocket cut, with a depth of 14.5 mm (Fig.5). Essentially, I specified for there to be an inner line and an outer line. Attached are the pictures for what the tool path looked like (Fig. 6). 

  After I finished the work on Aspire, I used the CNC Shopbot software to move the drill bit into the desired location. In attempt to conserve wood, I positioned the drill bit close to the other cuts. I then did a dry run of the cut by having the Z-axis slightly above what it would normally be (so it doesn't cut).

  Here is my final product! ![heart](./heart_final.jpg)Overall, I'm pretty happy with it! There's a slight notch in a corner because I cut too close to other cuts.


  ### Casting and Molding

  ### Background of Casting and Molding Idea
  I also wanted to make a statue of my hand holding my boyfriendâ€™s hand through casting and molding. This was inspired by an Instagram ad that I saw of a statue of a hand. To do this, I recruited my boyfriend (he was enthralled, of course, for the opportunity to hold my hand for an extended period of time). 


  ### Making the hand mold
  I used the skin safe (Alja-safe) alginate molding powder. The powder was pink-purple. I mixed water in a 1:1 ratio with water, per the instructions. The instructions also suggested using a hand mixer or a beater attached to a drill; however, I was unable to find one in the lab (and also could not find one in stock at the local CVS). Thus, I needed to hand-mix the powder and water. For future reference, Chris later on messaged in the slack that you could just attach a wooden spoon to a drill-- however I was a little unaware while making this. 
  The instructions suggested making a test mold of the thumb first. This went swimmingly, presumably in the hindsight because I needed to mix a smaller quantity of Alja-safe and water. Since the instructions suggested warm water, I used that. If anything, we could've had it harden faster. With this information, I then proceeded with this formation of my first hand mold

  1. 

  ###Filling in the plaster
  There were two types of plaster: hydrostone and drystone. I decided to test one version with the hydrostone and one version with the drystone. The hydrostone required (by weight) 32 parts of water for 100 parts of the powder. The drystone required (by weight) 18-20 parts (I used 20) of water for 100 parts of the powder. Then, the easier process would be used for third (ideally most perfect) mold.

  After the difficulty mixing the alginate mold (pink-purple powder) with water

  To note, the alginate mold indicated that we should fill in the plaster within 4 hours; after 4 hours, the alginate mold would begin to degrade.
