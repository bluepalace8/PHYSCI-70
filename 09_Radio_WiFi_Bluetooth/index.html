  ### Week 8: Radio, WiFi, Bluetooth (IoT)

 * For another week that incorporates Wifi, check out my work on week 11! :) 
  #Background on Project
Part of my final project includes communication between my microcontroller and 
Thus, this week, I am trying to see if I could have my ESP32 act as an access point! 

What is an access point? Well, this picture from Random nerd tutorials sums it up pretty well. 
 

# Thermosister

My potential final project is related to composting toilets. Hence, I thought it would be valuable to look into making a thermosister, which could be used in examples like measuring the temperature of the compost that comes out of the composting toilet. To do this, I looked at the Arduino create website as reference (https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Marcazzan_M/how-easy-is-it-to-use-a-thermistor-e39321). I then recreated the circuit displayed in the pictorial.

I then looked at the code corresponding to the thermosister and played around with it. Notably, the top 

# Capacitative sensing + Sound 

During lab on Thursday, Rob and I explored using capacitative sensing for sound. Essentially, we had put copper sheets in the metal bowl like so
