  ### Week 11: Computer Programming

## Background
  For this week's project, I'm using Firebase to give a visual display of if your compost is ready. 

I was inspired by the app "Is it dark outside," which is an ironic app that literally tells you if it's dark outside. It's the only thing the app does. 

I too, wanted to make a very simple interface much like "is it dark outside" that will tell you if your compost is ready. Hence, it's called "is your compost ready?" and will take input from a thermosister and display a red square if 

Although I plan on using my ESP32 for my final project as the access point, I wanted to explore how to use Firebase, which relies on a router with internet access.


## Arduino code and Breadboard (Input)
I set up my breadboard to have a thermositer. Thus, temperature could be an input. I've worked on running and calibrated the thermositer in a previous week (see electronic input week)

I first had to 

To note, I had to use the Makerspace Wifi since it has less security, which allows this to work. 

This then feeds it into the Firebase

##Firebase

This is what the Realtime database looks like
Based on 
Hence, right now, since the temperature is not >25 degrees Celsius (As verified by, it says "not ready"
 
## Html Interface
When the Firebase displays "not ready", it displays a red square
![not ready](./not_ready.png)
![red square](./red_square.png)

When the Firebase displays "ready", the html website displays a green square. 
![ready](./ready.png)
