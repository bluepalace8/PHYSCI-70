  ### Week 1: Introduction 

  Going into this week, I had a couple of ideas. 
  1. Having something that could create a model of proteins. I really like proteins and was imagining 3D printing amino acids and then having a machine that could link these amino acids into a linear pepetide. 

  Here is a [video describing peptide bond formation](.Peptide bond formation (video) _ Proteins _ Khan Academy.html)

  2. I'm super interested in toilets. For instance, researchers at Stanford have inve

  And here is a [link to an article describing a cool self-containing toilet](../index.html).


  3. Lab equipment. Problem is, the thing I primarily work with are pipettes and I can't think of what else our lab would need. I don't think making an electronic pipette would be super satisfying though since electronic/robotic pipettes

  For now, I think I'm going to go with project idea number 3 since it's the most concrete. But if 3 doesn't work out, I'll most likely do 1.
